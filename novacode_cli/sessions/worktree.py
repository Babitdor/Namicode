"""Git worktree lifecycle for parallel Nova sessions.

Each spawned session gets its own worktree so two agents working at once cannot
overwrite each other's files. The worktree is also what binds a child process to
its workspace: ``config._find_project_root`` walks up looking for ``.git`` and
tests ``git_dir.exists()``, which is true for the ``.git`` **file** a linked
worktree carries — so a child launched with ``cwd=<worktree>`` resolves
``settings.project_root`` to that worktree at import time, with no extra plumbing.

Worktrees live under ``~/.nova/worktrees/<repo-name>/<slug>``, deliberately
*outside* the repository: an in-repo worktree would be a second full copy inside
the parent session's search scope, so every grep/glob would return doubled hits.

Nothing here ever forces or discards work. Removal only happens for a worktree
that is clean and has no commits of its own; anything else is kept and reported
so the user can merge or delete it themselves.
