"""Collaborative planning council — the place Nova thinks before it acts.

The original council (:mod:`novacode_cli.council`) is a *debate*: five personas
answer a question and vote for a winner. This module is a different thing built
from the same parts — a **planning stage** that runs before any code changes:

    brainstorm -> critique -> anonymous ranked vote -> judge -> user approval

and only then hands a structured, approved plan to the coding agent.

Three properties are the whole point, and each is enforced here rather than left
to prompt wording:

**Council agents never touch the repository.** They are called with
``model.ainvoke`` and nothing else — no tools are bound, so there is no file
write or shell call available to them by construction, not by instruction.

**Evaluation is anonymous.** Proposals are handed out under shuffled ids with
the authoring agent stripped, so critics and voters cannot see (or infer from
ordering) who wrote what. :func:`anonymize` is the only thing that builds the
text critics and voters see.

**Nothing executes without explicit approval.** ``run_planning_council`` ends at
``awaiting_approval``. Turning a plan into an implementation handoff requires a
separate :func:`approve` call, which refuses to act on a run in any other state.

Everything is a plain ``dict``-yielding async generator over injectable
``model``s, so the whole flow is unit-testable without HTTP — the same shape as
:func:`novacode_cli.council.run_council`.
