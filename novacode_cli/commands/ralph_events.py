"""UI-agnostic progress events for the ``/ralph`` command.

The Ralph handler (:mod:`novacode_cli.commands.ralph_handler`) is UI-agnostic:
its user-facing chatter goes through a Rich-markup ``emit`` sink, while the
*structured* milestones of a run (start, each iteration, the final summary, and
``--status`` snapshots) are reported through an optional ``on_event`` callback
that hands a renderer one of these dataclasses.

This mirrors :mod:`novacode_cli.init.events`: the classic REPL leaves
``on_event`` unset and keeps rendering the markup lines, while the Textual TUI
passes an ``on_event`` that drives native widgets (a run header card, live
per-iteration cards, a summary card, and a ``--status`` table) instead of a flat
stream of log lines.

Events flow one-way (handler -> renderer). They are additive: when ``on_event``
is ``None`` the handler falls back to its markup ``emit`` output unchanged.
