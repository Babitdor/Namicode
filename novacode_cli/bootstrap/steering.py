"""Steering middleware for injecting persistent user guidance into every model call.

Steering lets the user add standing instructions that persist across turns,
unlike regular chat messages which are "one and done."  Examples:

    /steer focus on the database layer
    /steer never modify test files without asking first
    /steer prioritize backward compatibility
    /steer use async patterns everywhere

These instructions are injected into every model call as a dedicated
section in the system prompt, ensuring the agent obeys them on every
turn — not just the one where they were typed.

The steering state is held in ``session_state.steering_instructions``,
a list of ``(label, instruction)`` tuples.  The ``/steer`` slash command
is the primary interface for managing them.

Architecture
-----------
``SteeringMiddleware`` sits in the agent middleware stack alongside
``GraphContextMiddleware``, ``ShellMiddleware``, etc.  It intercepts
every ``awrap_model_call`` and prepends the current steering instructions
to the system prompt, right after the base prompt but before any other
middleware injections.

The injection format is::

    [Steering Instructions]
    - focus on the database layer
    - never modify test files without asking first
    - prioritize backward compatibility
    [/Steering Instructions]

This is deliberately verbose — the agent sees these on every call, so
they act as persistent guardrails rather than one-off suggestions.
