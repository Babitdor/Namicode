"""Orpheus local TTS — LLM-based, very natural voices, via orpheus-cpp (CPU).

Orpheus is a 3B-param Llama-based TTS. The standard path uses vLLM + CUDA, which
isn't available on Windows / CPU-only machines, so this wrapper uses the
``orpheus-cpp`` (llama.cpp / GGUF) backend — fully local, no GPU, no API key.

Trade-off: it's heavy. The GGUF model is ~2GB (downloaded on first use) and
synthesis takes multiple seconds per reply on CPU. It's an **opt-in** provider;
Piper stays the low-latency default. Selected via ``/voice settings tts orpheus``.

The module imports cleanly without ``orpheus-cpp`` installed — heavy imports are
deferred into the methods, and :func:`novacode_cli.audio.is_orpheus_available`
gates selection with an install hint.
