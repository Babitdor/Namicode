"""Host-path → virtual-path normalization for filesystem tools.

## Why this exists

Nova's agents are told to address files with **virtual paths starting with
``/``** rooted at the project (``/novacode_cli/x`` → ``<project>/novacode_cli/x``).
But the model constantly *sees* real host paths — in the IDE's open-file context,
in ``@file`` mentions, in prior tool output, in error traces — and so it very
often passes a real **host absolute path** to a file tool, e.g.::

    read_file("B:/Summer Project 2026/Nova-Code/nova-code-cli/novacode_cli/prompts/plan_agent.jinja")

deepagents' ``validate_path`` (called by ``FilesystemMiddleware`` before the
backend) then rejects it hard::

    Error: Windows absolute paths are not supported: B:/… Please use virtual
    paths starting with / (e.g., /workspace/file.txt)

Telling the agent "don't do that" in the prompt isn't enough — it slips up
constantly. :func:`host_path_to_virtual` rewrites any host absolute path **that
points inside the project** into the equivalent ``/``-rooted virtual path, so the
mistake becomes harmless. It is applied by monkey-patching ``validate_path`` (see
:func:`novacode_cli.utils.backend_patches.apply_filesystem_host_path_patch`).

Paths that are already virtual, relative, or outside the project are returned
unchanged, so genuinely-invalid paths still surface deepagents' helpful error.
Handles Windows (``B:\\…`` / ``B:/…``, case-insensitive) and POSIX
(``/home/user/project/…``) host paths.
