"""Council of agents — independent answers + democratic voting.

A *council* takes a single question and runs it past five distinct personas,
each backed by the session's configured model but given its own personality.
Every member answers **independently** (it cannot see the others' answers), then
each casts a **single democratic vote** for the best answer (never its own). The
**majority** answer is the verdict.

:func:`run_council` is a pure async generator yielding plain ``dict`` events, so
it can be unit-tested without HTTP and rendered by the ``/council`` web server as
