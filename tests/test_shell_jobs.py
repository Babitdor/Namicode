"""Foreground shell control: Esc must kill a hung command promptly.

The shell tool runs its subprocess in a detached thread+loop that Textual task
cancellation can't reach, so before this a hung command froze the UI for the
full timeout (and could crash on force-quit). ``shell.jobs`` publishes a control
the TUI sets on Esc; the middleware read loop polls it and terminates.
